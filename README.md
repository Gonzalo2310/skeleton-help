For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

Support system modifications or enhancements should not be applied here but in the original repository.

This project is an helper visualizer created with [SDras-Helper](https://github.com/Gonzalo2310/SDras-Helper).

The result is a Vue component and a scaffolding with an integrated example is delivered here.

The result of [SDras-Helper](https://github.com/Gonzalo2310/SDras-Helper) is a folder with the integrated component and a set of files that form the help.

The folder is the project name in question and to adapt it, just follow these steps:

* Copy the help project folder to **src/components/** 
* Change the following line of **src/App.vue** `import helper from './components/Example/helper'` to `import projectname from './components/projectname/helper'`.

And you will simply have already adapted the help created with the above mentioned program.
